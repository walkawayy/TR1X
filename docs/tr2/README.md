TR2X is finished with the decompilation and is now able to run without the
original game .exe. The focus is now to clean up the code base and enrich the
game with new enhancements and features.

## Windows / Linux

### Installing (manual)

1. Head over to GitHub releases: https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases
2. Download the TR2X zip file.
3. Extract the TR2X zip file into a directory of your choice.  
   Make sure you choose to overwrite existing directories and files.
4. (First time installation) Put your original game files into the target directory.
5. To play the game, run `TR2X.exe`.

## macOS

### Installing

1. Head over to GitHub releases: https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases
2. Download the `TR2X-Installer.dmg` installer image. Mount the image and drag TR2X to the Applications folder.
3. Run TR2X from the Applications folder. This will show you an error dialog about missing game data files. This is expected at this point, as you have not copied them in yet. However, it's important to run the app first to allow macOS to verify the app bundle's signature.
4. Find TR2X in your Applications folder. Right-click it and click "Show Package Contents".
5. Copy your Tomb Raider 2 game data files into `Contents/Resources`.
